3) Installation
---------------
Briefly, the following shell commands should configure, build, and install
this package on the default directories:

        $ make
        $ sudo make install

4) Installation Informations
----------------------------
By default, 'make install' installs the package on the following
directories:

        /usr/local/bin/                   Executable files
        /usr/local/share/man/man6/        Man page
        /var/games/                       HighScore files

5) Advanced Installation
------------------------
You can specify a custom root directory for the installation (other
than '/'). To do this, give 'make install' the option DESTDIR=CUSTOM_ROOT,
where CUSTOM_ROOT must be an absolute directory name.
For example:

        $ make install DESTDIR=test/dir

This way, the file hierarchy will be:

        test/dir/usr/local/bin/             Executable files
        test/dir/usr/local/share/man/man6/  Man page
        test/dir/var/games/nsnake/          HighScore files

You can also specify an installation prefix other than '/usr/local' by
giving 'make' the option PREFIX=CUSTOM_PREFIX, where CUSTOM_PREFIX must be an
absolute directory name.
For example:

	$ make install PREFIX=test/dir

This way, the file hierarchy will be:

        test/dir/bin/                      Executable files
        test/dir/share/                    Man page
        /var/games/nsnake/                 HighScore files

To customize the highscores directory, modify SCOREDIR:

	$ make install SCOREDIR=test/dir

This way, the highscore directory will be:

        test/dir/                          HighScore files

6) Uninstallation
-----------------
To uninstall this package, by default:

        $ sudo make uninstall

To purge (remove also the HighScore files and Man page) go for:

        $ sudo make purge

7) Advanced Uninstallation
--------------------------

If you specified a custom root directory for installation, 'make' needs to
know about it to uninstall properly:

        $ make uninstall DESTDIR=test/dir

The same logic applies to purging:

        $ make purge DESTDIR=test/dir

If you installed it with a custom prefix, do the same:

        $ make uninstall PREFIX=test/dir

        $ make purge PREFIX=test/dir

        $ make purge SCOREDIR=test/dir

8) Dependences
--------------

To build nSnake from source, it requires the ncurses developer library:
      libncurses5-dev (>= 5.7)

Note that this is not the one that comes by default with the distribution.
To get ncurses-dev, use your favorite package manager. An 'apt' example:

        $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

or

        $ sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
