`nsnake` is a clone of the classic snake game that we all used to
play on our cellphones. You play this game on the terminal,
with textual interface.

Here's some features:

* Customizable gameplay, appearance and key bindings
* GUI-like interface with nice animations
* Levels - create your own [easily][level_wiki];
* Lots of possible game modes; teleport, scroll map, random walls,
  etc. Scores are saved for each setting.

## Controls

The keybindings are completely customizable on the in-game menus.
The default ones are:

| Keys              | Actions                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Arrow Keys        | Moves the snake            |
| q                 | Quits the game at any time |
| p                 | Pauses/Unpauses the game   |
| h                 | Show help during game      |

All user settings are located at `~/.local/share/nsnake`.

## Levels

nSnake looks out for level files on `~/.local/share/nsnake/levels`. By default
it installs stock levels on `/usr/share/games/nsnake/levels`, so make sure to
copy them before playing.

Levels have a `.nsnake` extension and are simple text files.  The file
format is very easy to edit; check out [the wiki][level_wiki] for a quick guide.

## Dependencies

nSnake only depends on `ncurses`; it's used to show cute things on the terminal.

Make sure you have the package *ncurses dev*. Note that it's _not_ the default
that comes with your distro.

| Distro         | Installation command              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Ubuntu/Debian  | `apt-get install libncurses5-dev` |
| Fedora         | `yum install ncurses-devel`       |
| Arch Linux     | _comes by default_                |

If you know the means to install on other distros, [please tell me][issues].

## Usage

Briefly, the following shell commands should configure,
build and install this package on the default directories:

    $ make
    $ [sudo] make install

If you want to test it before installing, do:

    $ make run

Then, it's simple:

	$ man nsnake
	$ nsnake

Check file `INSTALL.md` for more info.

## Translate
For translate other languages
1. Create directory for the specific language such as    
    es_AR/LC_MESSAGES/po into lang directory:

        $ mkdir  {language(es_AR)}/LC_MESSAGES/po -p

2. Copy template nsnake.po to created directory:

        $ cp nsnake.po  {language}/LC_MESSAGES/po

3. Translate text into template
4. Move to LC_MESSAGES directory
4. Exectute msgfmt -c -v -o nsnake.mo po/nsnake.po, this    
   command compile nsnake.po and generate nsnake.mo
   which uses the compiled system:

        $ msgfmt -c -v -o nsnake.mo po/nsnake.po

## Credits

Firstly, I'd like to thank you for playing this game.
Hope you liked it!

The game was mainly done by me, but a lot of people helped me in
many ways. There's a list of them on the `AUTHORS` file, and you
can see people's [contributions to the code here][contrib].

Throughout the nsnake development, I found very interesting sources
of ideas; small games made in C, textual games with ncurses, and
stuff like that.

I raise my hat to:

* *nInvaders*: A space invaders-like game using ncurses.
  * homepage: http://ninvaders.sourceforge.net
  * comments: "Thanks for the inspiration. If I haven't installed
               this in first place, I'd never have the idea
			   for nsnake"

* *pacman4console*: A console-based pacman game.
  * homepage:  http://doctormike.googlepages.com/pacman.html
  * comments:  "The way this package was organized
                    is incredible. Thanks for the
                    general packaging ideas"

* *vadorz*: An addicting ncurses space-invaders game.
  * homepage: http://code.google.com/p/vadorz/
  * comments: "This package is awesome, 'cause it uses ncurses
               AND pdcurses to be able to play in Windows and
			   GNU/Linux"

* *snake4*: Fruit-eating snake game
  * homepage: http://shh.thathost.com/
  * comments: "Thanks for the Makefile ideas. It's
               very well-written."
